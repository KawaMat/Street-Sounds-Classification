# Street-sounds-classification
Feature extraction and classification of sounds collected from city streets.

This project is an example of applying ML to sound classification problems. It involves extracting features from sounds and creating a classifier model. The data comes from the Kaggle database contains 8732 labeled sound excerpts (<=4s) of urban sounds from 10 classes: 
- air_conditioner, 
- car_horn, 
- children_playing, 
- dog_bark,
- drilling,
- enginge_idling, 
- gun_shot, 
- jackhammer, 
- siren,
- street_music.
